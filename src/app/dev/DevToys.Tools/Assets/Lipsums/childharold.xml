    <text>
        oh thou in hellas deemed of heavenly birth
        muse formed or fabled at the minstrels will
        since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth
        mine dares not call thee from thy sacred hill
        yet there ive wandered by thy vaunted rill
        yes sighed oer delphis longdeserted shrine
        where save that feeble fountain all is still
        nor mote my shell awake the weary nine
        to grace so plain a talethis lowly lay of mine

        whilome in albions isle there dwelt a youth
        who ne in virtues ways did take delight
        but spent his days in riot most uncouth
        and vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of night
        ah me in sooth he was a shameless wight
        sore given to revel and ungodly glee
        few earthly things found favour in his sight
        save concubines and carnal companie
        and flaunting wassailers of high and low degree

        childe harold was he hight but whence his name
        and lineage long it suits me not to say
        suffice it that perchance they were of fame
        and had been glorious in another day
        but one sad losel soils a name for aye
        however mighty in the olden time
        nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay
        nor florid prose nor honeyed lines of rhyme
        can blazon evil deeds or consecrate a crime

        childe harold basked him in the noontide sun
        disporting there like any other fly
        nor deemed before his little day was done
        one blast might chill him into misery
        but long ere scarce a third of his passed by
        worse than adversity the childe befell
        he felt the fulness of satiety
        then loathed he in his native land to dwell
        which seemed to him more lone than eremites sad cell

        for he through sins long labyrinth had run
        nor made atonement when he did amiss
        had sighed to many though he loved but one
        and that loved one alas could neer be his
        ah happy she to scape from him whose kiss
        had been pollution unto aught so chaste
        who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss
        and spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste
        nor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste

        and now childe harold was sore sick at heart
        and from his fellow bacchanals would flee
        tis said at times the sullen tear would start
        but pride congealed the drop within his ee
        apart he stalked in joyless reverie
        and from his native land resolved to go
        and visit scorching climes beyond the sea
        with pleasure drugged he almost longed for woe
        and een for change of scene would seek the shades below

        the childe departed from his fathers hall
        it was a vast and venerable pile
        so old it seemed only not to fall
        yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle
        monastic dome condemned to uses vile
        where superstition once had made her den
        now paphian girls were known to sing and smile
        and monks might deem their time was come agen
        if ancient tales say true nor wrong these holy men

        yet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood
        strange pangs would flash along childe harolds brow
        as if the memory of some deadly feud
        or disappointed passion lurked below
        but this none knew nor haply cared to know
        for his was not that open artless soul
        that feels relief by bidding sorrow flow
        nor sought he friend to counsel or condole
        whateer this grief mote be which he could not control

        and none did love him  though to hall and bower
        he gathered revellers from far and near
        he knew them flatterers of the festal hour
        the heartless parasites of present cheer
        yea none did love himnot his lemans dear
        but pomp and power alone are womans care
        and where these are light eros finds a feere
        maidens like moths are ever caught by glare
        and mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair

        childe harold had a mothernot forgot
        though parting from that mother he did shun
        a sister whom he loved but saw her not
        before his weary pilgrimage begun
        if friends he had he bade adieu to none
        yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel
        ye who have known what tis to dote upon
        a few dear objects will in sadness feel
        such partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal
