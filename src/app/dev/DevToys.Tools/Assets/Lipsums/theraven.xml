        once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary
        over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
        while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping
        as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door
        tis some visiter i muttered tapping at my chamber door
        only this and nothing more

        ah distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december
        and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
        eagerly i wished the morrow vainly i had sought to borrow
        from my books surcease of sorrowsorrow for the lost lenore
        for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
        nameless here for evermore

        and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
        thrilled mefilled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
        so that now to still the beating of my heart i stood repeating
        tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
        some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
        this it is and nothing more

        presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer
        sir said i or madam truly your forgiveness i implore
        but the fact is i was napping and so gently you came rapping
        and so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door
        that i scarce was sure i heard youhere i opened wide the door
        darkness there and nothing more

        deep into that darkness peering long i stood there wondering fearing
        doubting dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before
        but the silence was unbroken and the stillness gave no token
        and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore
        this i whispered and an echo murmured back the word lenore
        merely this and nothing more

        back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning
        soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before
        surely said i surely that is something at my window lattice
        let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore
        let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
        tis the wind and nothing more

        open here i flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter
        in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore
        not the least obeisance made he not a minute stopped or stayed he
        but with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door
        perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door
        perched and sat and nothing more

        then the ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling
        by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore
        though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou i said art sure no craven
        ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore
        tell me what thy lordly name is on the nights plutonian shore
        quoth the raven nevermore

        much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
        though its answer little meaninglittle relevancy bore
        for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
        ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door
        bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door
        with such name as nevermore

        but the raven sitting lonely on that placid bust spoke only
        that one word as if its soul in that one word he did outpour
        nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered
        till i scarcely more than muttered other friends have flown before
        on the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before
        then the bird said nevermore

        startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken
        doubtless said i what it utters is its only stock and store
        caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster
        followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore
        till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore
        of nevernevermore

        but the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling
        straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door
        then upon the velvet sinking i betook myself to linking
        fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore
        what this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore
        meant in croaking nevermore

        this i sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing
        to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosoms core
        this and more i sat divining with my head at ease reclining
        on the cushions velvet lining that the lamplight gloated oer
        but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating oer
        she shall press ah nevermore

        then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer
        swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor
        wretch i cried thy god hath lent theeby these angels he hath sent thee
        respiterespite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore
        quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore
        quoth the raven nevermore

        prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil
        whether tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore
        desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted
        on this home by horror hauntedtell me truly i implore
        is thereis there balm in gileadtell metell me i implore
        quoth the raven nevermore

        prophet said i thing of evilprophet still if bird or devil
        by that heaven that bends above usby that god we both adore
        tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant aidenn
        it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore
        clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore
        quoth the raven nevermore

        be that our sign of parting bird or fiend i shrieked upstarting
        get thee back into the tempest and the nights plutonian shore
        leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken
        leave my loneliness unbrokenquit the bust above my door
        take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door
        quoth the raven nevermore

        and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting
        on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door
        and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming
        and the lamplight oer him streaming throws his shadows on the floor
        and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
        shall be liftednevermore
