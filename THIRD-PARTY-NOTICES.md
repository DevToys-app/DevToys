such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a
Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory
patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License
for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
this License; and
You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You

following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted
for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of

liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or
any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has
been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS
MICROSOFT TYPESCRIPT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT
These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one 
of its affiliates) and you. They apply to the software named above. The terms also apply to any Microsoft 
services or updates for the software, except to the extent those have additional terms.
IF YOU COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW.
1.	INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS. You may install and use any number of copies of the software.
2.	TERMS FOR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS. 
a.	Utilities. The software may contain some items on the Utilities List at 
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=823097.  You may copy and install these Utilities, if 
included with the software, onto devices to debug and deploy your applications and databases 
you developed with the software. Please note that Utilities are designed for temporary use, that 
Microsoft may not be able to patch or update Utilities separately from the rest of the software, 
and that some Utilities by their nature may make it possible for others to access devices on which 
the Utilities are installed. As a result, you should delete all Utilities you have installed after you 
finish debugging or deploying your applications and databases.  Microsoft is not responsible for 
any third party use or access of Utilities you install on any device.
b.	Microsoft Platforms.  The software may include components from Microsoft Windows; 
Microsoft Windows Server; Microsoft SQL Server; Microsoft Exchange; Microsoft Office; and 
Microsoft SharePoint. These components are governed by separate agreements and their own 
product support policies, as described in the Microsoft "Licenses" folder accompanying the 
software, except that, if license terms for those components are also included in the associated 
installation directory, those license terms control.
c.	Third Party Components.  The software may include third party components with separate 
legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices 
file(s) accompanying the software. 
3.	DATA.  
a.	Data Collection. The software may collect information about you and your use of the software, 
and send that to Microsoft. Microsoft may use this information to provide services and improve 
our products and services.  You may opt-out of many of these scenarios, but not all, as described 
in the product documentation.  There are also some features in the software that may enable 
you and Microsoft to collect data from users of your applications. If you use these features, you 
must comply with applicable law, including providing appropriate notices to users of your 
applications together with a copy of Microsoft's privacy statement. Our privacy statement is 
located at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=824704. You can learn more about data 
collection and use in the help documentation and our privacy statement. Your use of the software 
operates as your consent to these practices.
b.	Processing of Personal Data. To the extent Microsoft is a processor or subprocessor of 
personal data in connection with the software, Microsoft makes the commitments in the 
European Union General Data Protection Regulation Terms of the Online Services Terms to all 
customers effective May 25, 2018, at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/gdpr. 
4.	SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights 
to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights 
despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In 
doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it 
in certain ways. For more information, see www.microsoft.com/licensing/userights. You may not
*	work around any technical limitations in the software;
*	reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or attempt to do so, except and only to 
the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open-source 
components that may be included with the software;
*	remove, minimize, block or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software; 
*	use the software in any way that is against the law; or
*	share, publish, rent, or lease the software, or provide the software as a stand-alone offering for 
others to use.
5.	EXPORT RESTRICTIONS. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and 
regulations that apply to the software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users and end 
use.  For further information on export restrictions, visit (aka.ms/exporting).
6.	SUPPORT SERVICES. Because this software is "as is," we may not provide support services for it.
7.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based 
services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support 
services.
8.	APPLICABLE LAW.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington law applies to 
interpretation of and claims for breach of this agreement, and the laws of the state where you live 
apply to all other claims. If you acquired the software in any other country, its laws apply.
9.	CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS. This agreement describes certain legal rights. 
You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state or country. 
Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to 
the party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights 
if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the 
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions 
apply to you:
a.	Australia. You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in 
this agreement is intended to affect those rights.
b.	Canada. If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off 
the automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-
connect to the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), 
or uninstalling the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off 
updates for your specific device or software.
c.	Germany and Austria.
(i)	Warranty. The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any 
Microsoft materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual 
guarantee in relation to the licensed software.
(ii)	Limitation of Liability. In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based 
on the Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is 
liable according to the statutory law.
Subject to the foregoing clause (ii), Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is 
in breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due 
performance of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this 
agreement and the compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal 
obligations"). In other cases of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

10.	DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK 
OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR 
CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT 
EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 
11.	LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES. YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT 
AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER 
ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, 
INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.
This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on 
third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of contract, breach of 
warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by 
applicable law.
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. 
The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the 
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
Please note: As this software is distributed in Quebec, Canada, some of the clauses in this 
agreement are provided below in French.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
